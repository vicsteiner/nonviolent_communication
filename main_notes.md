# Index and Subtopics Plus Key Points

**01. Givin From The Heart**
  * Introduction
    * NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.
  * A Way To Focus Attention
    * We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.
    * Let's shine the light of consciousness on places where we can hope to find what we are seeking.
  * The NVC Process
    * Four components of NVC:
      1. observations: the concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being 
      2. feelings: how we feel in relation to what we observe 
      3. needs: the needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings 
      4. requests: the concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives 
    * Two parts of NVC: 
      1. Expressing honestly through the four components 
      2. Receiving empathically through the four components 
  * Applying NVC In Our Lives And The World
  * NVC In Action: "Murderer, Assassin, Child-Killer!"
  
**02. Communication That Blocks Compassion**  

Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of compassion.  

  * Moralistic Judgments 
    * In the world of judgments, our concdern centers on "who is what". 
    * Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs. 
    * Classifying and judging people promotes violence. 
  * Making Comparisons 
    * Comparisons are a form of judgment. 
  * Denial Of Responsability 
    * Our language obscures awareness of personal responsability. 
    * We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice. 
    * We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsability for how we behave, think, and fell. 
  * Other Forms Of Life-Alienating Communication 
    * We can never make people do anything. 
    * Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication. 
    * Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.

# My Questions

Does NVC works if we are talking to someone with a trained discourse? 
Say a negotiatior from a country which has a completely rehearsed discourse. 
Can we connect to someone if it is like there is not someone?
