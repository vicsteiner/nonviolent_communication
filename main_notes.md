# Start the discussion: NVC

Do we communicate violently?

### *"If 'violent' means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much of how we communicate could indeed be called  'violent' communication."*

If we do not know the pain, hurt or harm our words caused to others we might never realize we have been violent.

Why the author himself thinks the title Nonviolent is not ideal?

  * It is in negative mode, telling what we should not do instead of what we should do. 

# 01-Givin From The Heart 

  * Introduction
    * NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.
  * A Way To Focus Attention
    * We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.
    * Let's shine the light of consciousness on places where we can hope to find what we are seeking.
  * The NVC Process
    * Four components of NVC:
      1. observations: the concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being 
      2. feelings: how we feel in relation to what we observe 
      3. needs: the needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings 
      4. requests: the concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives 
    * Two parts of NVC: 
      1. Expressing honestly through the four components 
      2. Receiving empathically through the four components 

## 01-Summary 

# 02-Communication That Blocks Compassion 

Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of compassion.  

  * Moralistic Judgments 
    * In the world of judgments, our concdern centers on "who is what". 
    * Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs. 
    * Classifying and judging people promotes violence. 
  * Making Comparisons 
    * Comparisons are a form of judgment. 
  * Denial Of Responsability 
    * Our language obscures awareness of personal responsability. 
    * We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice. 
    * We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsability for how we behave, think, and fell. 
  * Other Forms Of Life-Alienating Communication 
    * We can never make people do anything. 
    * Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication. 
    * Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.

# 05-Taken Responsability For Our Fellings 

  * Hearing A Negative Message: Four Options 
    * What others so may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause. 
    * Four options for receiving negative messages: 
      1. blame ourselves. 
      2. blame others. 
      3. sense our own feelings and needs. 
      4. sense others' feelings and needs. 
    * Connect your feeling with your need: " I feel ... because I need ... ". 
    * Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt. 
  * The Needs At The Roots Of Feelings 
    * Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs. 
    * If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met. 
  * The Pain Of Expressing Our Needs Versus The Pain Of Not Expressing Our Needs 
    * If we don't value our needs, others may not either. 
  * From Emotional Slavery to Emotional Liberation 
    * First stage: Emotional slavery. We see ourselves responsible for others' feelings. 
    * Second stage: The obnoxious stage. We feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others' feelings. 
    * Third stage: Emotional liberation. We take responsability for our own intentions and actions. 

## 05-Summary 

# 06-Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life 

  * Using Positive Action Language 
    * Use positive language when making requests. 
    * Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want. 
    * Vague language contributes to internal confusion. 
    * Depression is the reward we get for being "good". 
  * Making Requests Consciously 
    * When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do. 
    * We are often not conscious of what we are requesting. 
    * Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker's feelings and needs. 
    * The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we'll get it. 
  * Asking For a Reflection 
    * To make sure the message we sent is the message that's received, ask the listener to reflect it back. 
    * Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection. 
    * Empathize with the listener who doesn't want to reflect back. 
  * Requesting Honesty 
    * After we express ourselves vulnerably, we ofthen want to know: 
      1. what the listener is feeling; 
      2. what the listener is thinking; 
      3. wether the listener would be willing to take a particular action. 
  * Making Requests Of A Group 
    * In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren't certain what response they're wanting. 
  * Requests Versus Demands 
    * When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: to submit or to rebel. 
    * To tell if it's a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with. 
    * It's a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges. 
    * It's a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip. 
    * It's a request of the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person's needs. 
  * Defining Our Objective When Making Requests 
    * Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy. 

## 06-Summary 

# 07-Receiving Empathically 

The two parts of NVC: 
  1. expressing honestly 
  2. receiving honestly 

  * Presence: Don't Just Do Something, Stand There 
    * Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being. 
    * Asking before offering advice and reassurance. 
    * Intellectual understanding blocks empathy. 
  * Listening For Feelings And Needs 
    * No matter what others say, we only hear what they ate (1) observing, (2) feeling, (3) needing, and (4) requesting. 
    * Listen to waht people are needing rather than what they are thinking. 
  * Paraphrasing 
    * When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs. 
    * Reflect back messages that are emotinally charged. 
    * Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding. 
    * Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs. 
    * A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone's life. 
    * Paraphrasing saves time. 
  * Sustaining Empathy 
    * When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels of theselves. 
    * We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a release of tension, or (2) the flow of words come to halt. 
  * When Pain Blocks Our Ability To Empathize 
    * We need empathy to give empathy. 

## 07-Summary 

# 08-The Power Of Empathy 

  * Empathy That Heals 
    * Empathy allows us "to reperceive [our] world in a new way and to go on." 
    * "Don't just do something ...". 
    * It is harder to empathize with those who appear to posses more power, status, or resources. 
  * Empathy And The Ability To Be Vulnerable 
    * The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel. 
    * We "say a lot" by listening for the other people's feelings and needs. 
  * Using Empathy To Defuse Danger 
    * Rather than put your "but" in the face of an angry person, empathize. 
    * When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monster. 
    * It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us. 
  * Empathy In Hearing Someone's "No!" 
    * Empathizong with someone's "no" protects us from taking it personally. 
  * Empathy To Revive A Lifeless Conversation 
    * To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy. 
    * What bores the listener bores the speaker too. 
    * Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen. 
  * Empathy For Silence 
    * Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.

# 09-Connecting Compassionately With Ourselves 

NVC's most important use may be in developing self-compassion.

  * Remembering The Specialness Of What We Are

  * Translating Self-Judgments And Inner Demands 
    * Sel-judgments, like all judgments, are tragic expressions of unmet needs. 
  * NVC Mourning 
    * NVC mourning: connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions we now regret. 
  * Self-Forgiveness 
    * NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret. 
  * The Lesson Of The Polka-Dotted Suit 
    * We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part. 
  * Don't Do Anything That Isn't Play! 
    * We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation. 
  * Translating "Have To" To "Choose To" 
    * With every choice we make, be conscious of what need it serves. 
  * Cultivating Awareness Of The Energy Behind Our Actions 
    * Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or approval, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price you pay for them. 
    * The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things "because we're supposed to".

# 10-Expressing Anger Fully 

Hurting people is too superficial.

  * Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause 
    * We are never angry because of what others say or do. 
    * To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause. 
    * The cause of anger lies in our thinking - in thoughts of blame and judgment. 
  * All Anger Has A Life-Serving Core 
    * When we judge others, we contribute to violence. 
    * Use anger as a wake-up call. 
    * Anger co-opts our energy by diverting it toward punitive actions. 
  * Stimulus Versus Cause: Practical Implications 
    * When we become awae of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving feelings. 
    * Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment. 
    * We recall four options when hearing a difficult message: 
      1. Blame ourselves 
      2. Blame others 
      3. Sense our own feelings and needs 
      4. Sense others' feelings and needs
    * Judgments of others contribute to self-fulfilling prophecies. 
  * Four Steps To Expressing Anger 
    * Steps to expressing anger: 
      1. Stop. Breathe. 
      2. Identify our judgmental thoughts. 
      3. Connect with our needs. 
      4. Express our feelings and unmet needs. 
  * Offering Empathy First 
    * The more we hear them, the more they'll here us. 
    * Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise on our minds, without judging them. 
    * When we hear another person's fellings and needs, we recognize our common humanity. 
    * Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain. 
    * People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault. 
  * Taking Our Time 
    * Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need. 
    * Take your time.

# My Questions

Does NVC works if we are talking to someone with a trained discourse? 

Say a negotiatior from a country which has a completely rehearsed discourse. 

Can we connect to someone if it is like there is not someone?
